Anyrun

Anyrun is the first in a series of 'HackFriday' production. This formula allows designers and developers to work in unison on an internal Wherecloud mobile product.

THE CHALLENGE   
Anyrun started out as an 'HackFriday' idea initiated at Wherecloud in early 2015\. Our challenge was to create a beautiful and extremely simple food ordering application connected with the real-time experience of a chatting application. As with any chat application, the application needed to have simple group management capabilities and effective use of push notifications. The realtime experience had to be completed with push notifications so group members would be properly notified the new food runs would be started. Above the technical and UX challenges, our biggest one was devoting time and focus on delivering a Wherecloud internal product with a well-defined functional set. 

THE SOLUTION   
Anyrun was created in a very incremental manner. We kept the original 'HackDay' idea but rewrote the complete application using Apple's newest programming language: Swift. We also leverage Parse (before they announced termination of the service) and Firebase (from Google) for the real-time communication aspect. Every 'HackFriday' we devoted more time to the project until we decided to block a continuous block of work to finish and deliver the application to the AppStore. Our end goal was to provide a beautifully crafted application, true to everything else we do at Wherecloud. An easy to use mobile application to allow friends to do food runs together.
